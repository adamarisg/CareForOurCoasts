    <h1>How you can help!</h1>
    <h2 class ="help-title"> Using plastic free alternatives </h2>
    <p class= "help-blurb"> So why should you use plastic free alternatives? Its a simple question with a powerful solution. Replacing simple items such as plastic bags with reusable bags and plastic bottles with reusable bottles helps a ton. These alternatives don't cost much these days and in the long run switching will improve your carbon footprint!</p>

    <h2 class="help-title"> Voting on ocean policies</h2>
    <p class="help-blurb"> By voting on ocean issues and electing public officials that care about our oceans, we can help protect marine life. If you can't vote just yet don't fret! Do research on running candidates and encourage adults to vote.</p> 
    
    <h2 class="help-title"> Contacting local representatives</h2>
    <p class="help-blurb"> Not everyone knows about and understands how big of an impact marine pollution causes. So inform those who can let others know. Contact your loval representatives and lawmakers to remind them of these issues. You never know, even a phone call can help.</p> 

    <h2 class ="help-title"> Picking up trash at the beach </h2>
    <p class="help-blurb"> Now this one is very important. It always important to never litter and at the beach especially. So the next time you go to a beach on a nice day remember to pick up some trash. There is no doubt that there will be some lingering around. Now don't go picking up every single piece on the beach. Just do your best to keep the beach clean!</p>
