    <p class="blurb"> After hearing about Kamilo beach in Hawaii, and how trash infested it had become I realized that things had to change. A once beutiful beach now looked and felt more like a land fill. Not only was it unsettling it was also upsetting. I began to think of local Hawaiians and how they were probably outraged by the conditions of the beach.</p>
